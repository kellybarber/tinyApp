# tinyAPP Project

  tinyAPP is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (a la bit.ly).

  The site is fully functional, with user authentication and url storage. Additionally, it remembers users solely to maintain their url library, and does not track or hold onto any additional information. This makes tinyAPP unique as a URL shortener that does not monitor its userbase.

  Meaningful styling has yet to be added. I will be remedying this as time permits.
